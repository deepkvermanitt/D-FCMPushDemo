# D-FCMPushDemo
This is a basic demo app that shows how to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) in an Android project built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It helps you understand how to receive push notifications when the app is open, in the background, or even when it's closed â€” and how to handle what happens when a user taps on a notification.
